# Bit Indie Codebase Health Report

## Architecture & Organization
- The backend follows a classic FastAPI service layout with a dedicated application factory and modular routers, keeping concerns well separated and making dependency injection straightforward.【F:apps/api/src/bit_indie_api/main.py†L1-L42】
- Core domain logic sits in service layers such as `GameDraftingService`, which encapsulate validations, dependency wiring, and side effects behind clear docstrings and focused methods. This makes business rules discoverable and easier to test in isolation.【F:apps/api/src/bit_indie_api/services/game_drafting.py†L1-L135】
- The Next.js storefront keeps API access behind typed client helpers and funnels landing-page logic through a single `NeonLanding` component, which composes smaller presentation sections for clarity.【F:apps/web/app/page.tsx†L1-L39】【F:apps/web/components/landing/neon-landing.tsx†L1-L185】

## Code Quality & Patterns
- Backend modules consistently use typed dataclasses, custom exceptions, and docstrings to communicate intent. Price validation, slug enforcement, and Lightning address requirements are enforced centrally rather than in routes, reducing duplication.【F:apps/api/src/bit_indie_api/services/game_drafting.py†L36-L134】
- Frontend utilities such as `lib/format.ts` provide shared formatting helpers with documented options, avoiding inline string manipulation throughout the UI.【F:apps/web/lib/format.ts†L1-L102】
- Data fetching on the landing page cleanly separates catalog and featured loads with error guards, surfacing a `hadLoadFailure` banner without crashing the UI.【F:apps/web/app/page.tsx†L14-L39】【F:apps/web/components/landing/neon-landing.tsx†L125-L185】

## Test Coverage & Tooling
- The FastAPI layer has extensive pytest suites that spin up isolated in-memory databases, assert domain errors, and exercise service orchestration, demonstrating a healthy focus on regression safety.【F:apps/api/tests/test_services_game_drafting.py†L1-L125】
- Node-based unit tests cover the Next.js data clients, mocking `fetch` and validating error handling paths so the web app enforces request contracts.【F:apps/web/lib/api/comments.test.ts†L1-L79】
- The web package ships with TypeScript compilation for tests and lint/build scripts wired through the workspace, signaling a thoughtful developer experience even before E2E coverage is introduced.【F:apps/web/package.json†L1-L24】【F:apps/web/tsconfig.test.json†L1-L27】

## Opportunities
- Consider expanding frontend test coverage beyond API clients to include critical UI logic (e.g., the landing screen state machine) with component tests or story-driven assertions.
- The catalog loader currently logs errors to the server console; capturing these events with a shared telemetry hook would improve observability across both web and API layers.
- As the project grows, documenting cross-service workflows (purchase lifecycle, moderation) in `docs/` could help onboard contributors faster by pairing prose with the existing strong service abstractions.
